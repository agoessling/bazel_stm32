If you are using an STM32 with the STM32 driver library then ensure all the priority bits are
assigned to be preempt priority bits by calling NVIC_PriorityGroupConfig( NVIC_PriorityGroup_4 );
before the RTOS is started.

Cortex-M interrupts default to having a priority value of zero. Zero is the highest possible
priority value. Therefore, never leave the priority of an interrupt that uses the interrupt safe
RTOS API at its default value.
